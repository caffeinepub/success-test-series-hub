Includes free/paid test series, AI-powered question generator, top rankers leaderboard, exam categories, and a contact form. Has a login system and admin panel. Now adding: homepage image slider with admin management, OTP-based mobile login replacing password login, student profile with photo upload, daily current affairs and newspaper sections, bilingual (Hindi/English) tests with negative marking, bank payment details display, and enhanced admin panel with slider/current affairs/newspaper management.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Backend API endpoints expected: GET /tests (returns test list) and POST /ai/generate (returns AI-generated questions)",
    "Admin panel requires authentication — implement login with role-based access (admin vs. regular user)",
    "Student login requires separate auth flow from admin — consider separate student session tokens and a student registration/login backend function",
    "Current Affairs tests should include an explanation field per question — update the question schema to support optional explanation text",
    "Bilingual support required: all test questions, options, explanations, and UI text must support both Hindi and English. Consider a language toggle in the header and storing question content in both languages in the backend schema.",
    "Payment gateway integration planned — Razorpay or UPI gateway; each test will have a price field; students must pay before unlocking non-free tests",
    "OTP login replaces password login for students — backend must support mobile number storage and OTP generation/validation (simulated since external SMS APIs unavailable)",
    "Image slider data (poster URLs) should be stored in the backend actor and manageable via admin CRUD; frontend fetches and displays them dynamically"
