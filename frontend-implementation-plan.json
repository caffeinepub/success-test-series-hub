For Login mode: render Mobile Number (input type='tel', 10-digit numeric validation) and Password (input type='password') fields with inline error messages. For Register mode: render Mobile Number, Password, and Confirm Password fields with password-match validation. On form submission, call useStudentLogin (Login mode) or useStudentRegister (Register mode) mutation hooks from useQueries.ts. On successful login, store the session token via setStudentAuthToken from useStudentAuth and navigate to /student-dashboard using the onNavigate callback. Display inline error messages for invalid credentials, validation failures, or backend errors. Use shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Card, Tabs) for consistent styling with the existing design system. Ensure mobile number validation enforces exactly 10 numeric digits."
