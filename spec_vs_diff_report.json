  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements. REQ-1 backend changes are present (Student type with password field, registerStudent, studentLogin). REQ-2 hooks useStudentLogin and useStudentRegister are added in useQueries.ts. REQ-3 StudentLogin.tsx is replaced with a tabbed login/register form. One AC item is partially unverified: REQ-2 requires that on successful login, session token and student name are stored via useStudentAuth — the frontend page does call setStudentToken/setStudentName, but the useStudentLogin hook itself does NOT store them. The backend studentLogin returning a session token is implemented. Overall implementation is solid with minor nuances.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "On successful login, session token and student name are stored via useStudentAuth inside the useStudentLogin hook",
      "reason": "The useStudentLogin mutation in useQueries.ts only calls actor.studentLogin and returns the result without storing the session token or student name via useStudentAuth. The storing is done in the page component (StudentLogin.tsx), not inside the hook itself as specified.",
