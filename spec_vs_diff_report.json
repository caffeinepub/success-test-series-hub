  "summary": "The diff correctly updates the hardcoded admin credentials in backend/main.mo to 'STSHubsachin' and 'success@#2003', and the login() function validates against these new credentials. The validateSession() and admin-guarded functions remain intact. A migration module is also added to handle state schema changes. All core requirements of REQ-25 appear to be implemented.",

      "description": "A migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added to handle actor state migration from an old schema (with adminPasswordHash map) to a new schema (without it).",
      "reason": "The build request only asked to update hardcoded credentials in backend/main.mo. No migration infrastructure was requested, and the constraints explicitly say 'Do not change any other backend logic, data models, or existing CRUD functions.'",
